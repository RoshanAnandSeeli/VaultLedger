## 1. Project Overview

**VaultLedger** is a full-featured core banking desktop simulation application built using **Java 17**, **JavaFX**, and **SQLite**. It models how modern financial institutions manage account lifecycles, enforce relational integrity, execute atomic ACID transactions, and maintain an immutable, balanced double-entry accounting ledger.

The project demonstrates:
- **Strict Account Lifecycle Controls:** State machines enforcing `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, and terminal `CLOSED` statuses with explicit rules governing transaction eligibility and account deletion.
- **Atomic Operations (ACID):** Transactional guarantees across balance updates, transaction records, and ledger generation using SQLite transactions.
- **Immutable Double-Entry Ledger:** Every financial movement generates matched `DEBIT` and `CREDIT` entries that must balance to zero.
- **Deadlock-Free Concurrency Control:** In-memory, lexicographically-ordered `ReentrantLock` coordination across concurrent multi-account transfers.
- **Embedded Local Persistence:** Zero-configuration SQLite storage with automated schema creation, column migrations, and foreign key cascades.
- **High-Contrast Professional Banking Theme:** A desktop interface designed around high visual contrast, WCAG-compliant legibility, and structured financial tables.

## 7. Demo Data and Sample Records

VaultLedger includes a built-in `DemoDataSeeder` (`com.corebanking.config.DemoDataSeeder`) allowing users to populate a realistic, consistent banking dataset with one click.

### How Loading Demo Data Works
1. When you click **`Load Demo Data`** on the Dashboard, the application checks if bank code `NSB` exists.
2. **Idempotent Execution:** If `NSB` is already present, the loader returns immediately without modifying records or duplicating rows.
3. If not present, it seeds the bank, creates 3 customer accounts, and executes 5 initial financial operations.
4. All seeded entities are tagged with `is_demo = 1` in the database.

### Seeded Bank
- **Bank Code:** `NSB`
- **Bank Name:** `Northstar Bank`

### Seeded Accounts Table

| Account ID | Customer Name | Account Type | Initial Deposit | Net Starting Balance | Initial Status | Demonstration Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ACC-JOSHUA` | Joshua | `SAVINGS` | ₹1,000.00 | **₹1,250.00** | `ACTIVE` | Primary transacting account with deposit, withdrawal, and outward transfer history |
| `ACC-ROSHAN` | Roshan | `CURRENT` | ₹500.00 | **₹800.00** | `ACTIVE` | Intermediary business account receiving rent and transferring dinner reimbursement |
| `ACC-ALICE` | Alice | `SAVINGS` | ₹250.00 | **₹300.00** | `ACTIVE` | Recipient account demonstrating incoming transfer |

### Seeded Transaction Sequence & Final State

1. **Deposit:** `₹500.00` deposited into `ACC-JOSHUA` (Balance: `₹1,500.00`).
2. **Deposit:** `₹200.00` deposited into `ACC-ROSHAN` (Balance: `₹700.00`).
3. **Withdrawal:** `₹100.00` withdrawn from `ACC-JOSHUA` (Balance: `₹1,400.00`).
4. **Transfer:** `₹150.00` transferred from `ACC-JOSHUA` to `ACC-ROSHAN` ("Rent payment") (Joshua: `₹1,250.00`, Roshan: `₹850.00`).
5. **Transfer:** `₹50.00` transferred from `ACC-ROSHAN` to `ACC-ALICE` ("Dinner") (Roshan: `₹800.00`, Alice: `₹300.00`).

**Expected Dashboard Metrics after Seeding:**
- **Total Accounts:** `3`
- **Active Accounts:** `3`
- **Transactions:** `5`
- **Customer Balances:** `₹2,350.00`
- **Total Ledger Entries:** `10` (5 Debits totaling `₹1,000.00` and 5 Credits totaling `₹1,000.00`)

### Scenario 8: Transaction Receipts & Audit Ledger Inspection
- **Objective:** Trace an end-to-end transaction from receipt to double-entry ledger verification.
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to **`⇄ Transactions`**.
  2. Double-click the latest transaction in the list.
  3. Review the **Transaction Receipt**: Confirm Transaction ID, exact Date/Time, From Account, To Account, Amount, and `SUCCESS` status. Click `Close Receipt`.
  4. Navigate to **`📒 Ledger`**.
  5. Enter that Transaction ID into the search filter.
- **Expected Outcome:** Exactly 2 rows are displayed (1 DEBIT and 1 CREDIT) matching the transaction amount. The bottom audit banner displays equal Debits and Credits with the green **`BALANCED`** indicator.

---

### Scenario 9: Database Persistence After Application Restart
- **Objective:** Prove data integrity across application restarts using SQLite disk storage.
- **Steps:**
  1. Note the current metrics on the Dashboard (e.g., Total Accounts, Customer Balances).
  2. Close the VaultLedger application window.
  3. In your terminal, restart the app: `mvn javafx:run`.
- **Expected Outcome:** All customer accounts, updated balances, transaction histories, and ledger journal entries remain completely intact.

---

### Scenario 10: Safe Reset and Recovery
- **Objective:** Safely reset demo records, verify user data preservation, and perform full workspace reset.
- **Test Case 10A: Reset Demo Data Only**
  1. Ensure you have user-created accounts (from Scenario 2) and demo accounts (`ACC-JOSHUA`, `ACC-ROSHAN`, `ACC-ALICE`).
  2. Click **`Reset Demo Data`** on the Dashboard.
  3. Modal shows affected demo records count. Click **`Reset Demo Data`**.
  - **Result:** Demo accounts and demo transactions are deleted. Your user-created account (`Kavita Sharma`) remains safely preserved in the database.
- **Test Case 10B: Reset Entire Local Workspace**
  1. Click **`Reset Entire Local Workspace`**.
  2. Notice the `Reset Entire Database` button is disabled.
  3. Type `RESET ALL DATA` into the confirmation field.
  4. Click **`Reset Entire Database`**.
  - **Result:** All records are purged. The application returns to a clean zero-state.
  5. Click **`Load Demo Data`** to repopulate the environment immediately.

        string created_at
        int is_demo
    }
```

### Concurrency Architecture (`AccountLockManager`)
When executing multi-account operations (such as transfers), acquiring locks in arbitrary order risks **deadlocks** if two threads attempt simultaneous reciprocal transfers (e.g., Thread 1: Account A → B; Thread 2: Account B → A).

`AccountLockManager` solves this by:
1. Taking the two account IDs into a list.
2. Sorting the account IDs lexicographically (`Collections.sort(accountIds)`).
3. Acquiring `ReentrantLock` for the smaller ID first, then the larger ID.
4. Wrapping lock release in an `AutoCloseable` `LockScope` to guarantee release even if exceptions occur.

## 10. Core Banking Business Rules

| Domain Rule | Enforcement Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Transaction Eligibility** | Only accounts with `status = 'ACTIVE'` can participate in deposits, withdrawals, or transfers. `INACTIVE` and `CLOSED` accounts immediately reject operations. |
| **No Overdrafts** | Withdrawals and transfers verify that `amount <= balance`. If violated, `InsufficientFundsException` is thrown and the database rolls back. |
| **Double-Entry Balance** | Every financial operation produces equal and offsetting DEBIT and CREDIT ledger entries (`debits == credits`). `validateBalancedEntries` runs prior to SQL commit. |
| **Positive Monetary Amounts** | `MoneyUtil.requirePositive` verifies that amounts are strictly positive (`amount > 0.00`) and rejects negative or zero figures. |
| **Zero-Balance Account Closure** | Accounts cannot be closed while retaining funds. `closeAccount` requires `balance.signum() == 0`. |
| **Deletion Constraints** | Accounts can only be deleted if `status == CLOSED`. If foreign key references exist in `transactions` or `ledger_entries`, deletion is blocked by SQLite foreign key integrity. |
| **Distinct Transfer Parties** | A transfer cannot have identical source and destination accounts (`fromAccountId != toAccountId`). |
| **Precision Guarantee** | Monetary balances and amounts are handled exclusively using `java.math.BigDecimal` and stored in SQLite as `TEXT` to eliminate IEEE-754 floating-point rounding errors. |

## 12. Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Q1: The application fails to start with `JavaFX runtime components are missing`.
**Solution:** Always launch the project using Maven:
```bash
mvn javafx:run
```
The Maven OpenJFX plugin automatically configures the Java module path and native graphics libraries for your operating system.

### Q2: I get a Java version error when running Maven.
**Solution:** Verify that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to a JDK 17 installation. Run `java -version` to confirm version 17 or higher.

### Q3: My dashboard shows zero accounts and no transactions.
**Solution:** The database is in a clean initial state. Click **`Load Demo Data`** on the Dashboard Quick Actions panel to instantly seed sample records.

### Q4: Why is an account unable to perform a withdrawal or transfer?
**Solution:** Check the account's status in **`👥 Accounts`**. Only accounts with status `ACTIVE` can transact. If the account is `INACTIVE`, open its Account Details and click `Activate`. If the account is `CLOSED`, it can never be reactivated.

### Q5: Why was my account closure rejected?
**Solution:** Banking rules require an account to have a balance of exactly `₹0.00` before it can be closed. Withdraw or transfer out the remaining balance first.

### Q6: Can I delete an account with existing transactions?
**Solution:** No. SQLite foreign key constraints enforce audit trail integrity. Accounts with transaction history or ledger entries cannot be deleted, preserving compliance history.

### Q7: Where is the SQLite database stored on my computer?
**Solution:** The database file is located at `data/core-banking.db` inside the project root directory.
